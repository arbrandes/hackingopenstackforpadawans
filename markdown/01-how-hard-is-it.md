# How hard can it be?


## Hundreds of people do it


## Everything is documented, isn't it?


### Yes, but still...

Note: There are quite a bunch of hoops to jump through.


## Choose what to contribute
Note: Ok, so you're ready to contribute!  But what, exactly?  OpenStack has
several areas of activity that need your support to make the project work: it's
not all about submitting code.


## Open a bug or blueprint
Note: One of the first things a newcomer might want to contribute begins and
ends at Launchpad.  If you find a bug in OpenStack, you should report it -
making sure not to create duplicates by searching for previous reports.  If it
already exists and nobody's working on it, take it!

Blueprints essentially keep everybody on the same page as far as a new feature
is concerned, without the need for constant restatement in chat rooms or
mailing lists.  The status of each blueprint is tracked closely through each
release cycle, so that, for instance, anybody can see at a glance whether
implementation is in progress or whether it has stalled.  Any new feature
requires a corresponding blueprint.


## Sign the CLA
Note: Create Launchpad account, join the Foundation, sign in to
review.openstack.org, agree to the CLA, and optionally agree to the Corporate
CLA.  Phew!


## Start hacking


## Test!


## Talk, talk, talk
Note: Here's where we get to the meat of the contribution process.  How exactly
does one contribute code?  Basically, it involves joining the appropriate
communications channels (openstack-dev mailing list, and appropriate IRC
channels), and talking to the right people.  Like everything in life, right?


## Timing
Note:  The first step in understanding the code contribution process is
realizing that OpenStack is released on a timer: regardless of the state of any
given feature, a new OpenStack release will come out every six months. This
means that while one can work on anything at any time, the focus of the team
will be defined by the current stage: you may not get enough eyes on your
blueprint if you submit it during Pre-release, for example.  On the other hand,
a bug fix would be most welcome!


## Gerrit!
Note: Once you have some code, before you submit it you need to understand how
the Gerrit review system works.  Its objective is to simplify online reviews
for projects that use Git, as is the case with OpenStack.  With it, it becomes
easy to see whether a patch has been reviewed, by how many people, whether they
approve of it (or not!), and whether the patch fails any automated tests.
